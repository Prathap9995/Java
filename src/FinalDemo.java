/*Packages :-  It is set of classes and interfaces
 * java.lang :- is a default package and it comes with java compiler itself
 * java.util :- all the collection interfaces comes from util package
 * java.io :- to filereading and executing
 * Use defined :- what are all the classes user defined lies in user defined package
 * */
 
/*User defined package:- Where what are class user defined lies in this package
 * We can import user defined package from one class to another ---> only if both were lies in same package
 *By creating object we can use it:-   create object for other class and cl the method */

/*If our class from different package we need to import the package first to create object and to access the method */
